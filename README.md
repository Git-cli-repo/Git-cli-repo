## Hi there!!

<!--
I’m Rudra. 

I’m interested in programming, specifically, C# (for unity and for other use-cases), and occasionally JavaScript. I’m also interested in Game Development, Music Production, and sometimes writing.

I’m currently learning:
- more advanced C# 
- how to apply my C# and .NET knowledge 
- Unity Advanced

Currently, I’m working on a few really fun projects:
Hex Gems: A fantasy PvP card game where you duel against fellow spellcasters using magical spells crafted from Gems, where your goal is to eliminate all your enemies and be the last one standing. Check it out @ sparknspin.com/hexgems.
FewTileEffort: A difficult precision-platformer where you navigate through worlds across a limited set of tiles, each of which has a different effect, with the goal of reaching the end of the level. Check it out @ sparknspin.com/fewtileeffort.  
Hex Gems Dungeon Mode: A dungeon-crawling digital card game rougelite with floors, enemies, bosses, and tons more to explore. Check it out at @ error.invalid.link 

Here are some of the finished projects currently up and running on my GitHub profile: 
- (P3ON Serializer)[https://github.com/Git-cli-repo/p3on-csharp]: A custom data format with a C# Serialization library. 
- (TypeSalad)[https://github.com/Git-cli-repo/TypeSalad]: A library built with the goal of adding C#-like features into JS without the use of TypeScript.
